In this group project, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of song attributes to uncover trends in music evolution from the 1940s to the present, focusing on how characteristics such as BPM and danceability influence a song's popularity. We introduced innovative metrics like the "Hit Score" and "Cultural Resonance Score" to evaluate and predict song success. Our findings, documented in a Python notebook and presentation, provide valuable insights into the dynamics of musical trends and song popularity, showcasing our analytical capabilities in data science within the music industry.
